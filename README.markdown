What's this castle thing?
-------------------------

My home is my castle.

Using [Homesick](http://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick), you can preserve your castle (your dotfiles and anything else in your home directory) so that if your computer dies or you setup another computer, you can build your castle back up pretty quickly.
